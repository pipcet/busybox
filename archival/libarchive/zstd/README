Zstandard, or "zstd" as short version, is a fast lossless compression
algorithm, targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and
better compression ratios. It's backed by a very fast entropy stage, 
provided by the Huff0 and FSE library from 
https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy

Zstandard is currently deployed within Facebook. It is used continuously
to compress large amounts of data in multiple formats and use cases.

Zstandard is considered safe for production environments.

The files included here are from the current (Aug 6, 2021) development
branch at https://github.com/facebook/zstd.git

This directory contains only the minimum files needed to support zstd
decompression.
